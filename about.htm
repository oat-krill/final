                        My name is Jonathon McDaniel. I have always had the facility to draw. I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't drawing or painting. In this sense, art has always been a natural part of my existence. I was a tattooist for about three years but it never gave me the pleasure or enjoyment as creating the fantasies of others. Thats's what I do, I bring people's dreams and ideas of their own being or how they percieve themselves to life. 
                        <br><br> 
                        I've always enjoyed working with human and animal figures. I love the human figure and I want to draw and paint them as beautifully as I can. I am pulled into what I can do with a figure, anad how well I can do that, how close to perfection I can come. By "perfection" I don't mean how true to life but rather how true to a personal mental image or vision. I strive not only to copy life but also in a sense to enhance it. One can improve on the shape and proportions of a figure and on the fluidity in a painting. But one can also, as an artist, utterly enjoy a figure on it's own terms, even if it is imperfect by contemporary standards. When I'm not doing art I'm enjoying my family and watching my children grow.
